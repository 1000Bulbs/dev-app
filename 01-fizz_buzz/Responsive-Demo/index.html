				<h1>Responsive Design</h1>
				<p>Responsive design isn't all that difficult in terms of coding.  Sure, there's a slight learning curve understanding that the development is no longer about setting definitive widths and that there is specific css classes and selectors to enable such wizardry to collapse a website to a smartphone.  The real key to understanding responsive design, is understanding how you want your site to actually display on a device.  My rule, design for the device, and build upwards.  Because it can be much more difficult the other way around.  Besides, it also makes you focus on what elements are most important to your site, and your customers.  Can't fit everything comfortably inside an iPhone or Samsung screen... yet :-).</p>

				<h1>Purpose of This Page</h1>
				<p>I assembled this page to show the basics of responsive design.  There isn't too much involved, but it can be difficult.  Understanding how to collapse elements and which elements to collapse, how, where and a slew of other variables makes the task a challenging one.  What defines most important?  How should your visitors navigate?  Every detail has to be considered because the experience on a small device can be very challenging to even a seasoned iPhone user.  It's the unified experience that streamlines across all devices that makes a difference.</p>
