# Instruction:

    cd 01-fizz_buzz/ && node run -i %n

Where %n is the number of iterations you'd like to fizzbuzz through.

There are also some additional arguments you can provide

    node run --iterations 100 --fizz 3 --buzz 5

This will tell the program to fizz on divisible by 3, and buzz on divisible by 5, and to iterate 100 times.

Then just watch it go!

Run `npm test` and have mocha installed to run tests.
