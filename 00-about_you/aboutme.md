# About Me.

I find it difficult to write about [me](http://johnivanoff.com/?utm_source=gihub&utm_medium=gihub&utm_campaign=1000bulbs) since I am the most humble person in the world. *That statement seems a bit grand.*  
Unfortunately my apps are behind firewalls. I have written a few articles for [Rubysource.com](http://rubysource.com/author/jivanoff/).   
I have been promoting[web standards](http://blog.johnivanoff.com/2005/03/css-presentation.html?utm_source=gihub&utm_medium=gihub&utm_campaign=1000bulbs) for a long time.  
I write minimal code. That's one of the reasons I like ruby and rails. It's like my sense of [humor](http://blog.johnivanoff.com/2013/04/clean-pun.html?utm_source=gihub&utm_medium=gihub&utm_campaign=1000bulbs), DRY.  

Thank you for your time.

John Ivanoff
