# About Me.

I find it difficult to write about [me](http://johnivanoff.com/?utm_source=gihub&utm_medium=gihub&utm_campaign=1000bulbs) since I am the most humble person in the world.  

I have been promoting [web standards](http://blog.johnivanoff.com/2005/03/css-presentation.html?utm_source=gihub&utm_medium=gihub&utm_campaign=1000bulbs) for a long time.  

Since Sitepoint contacted me a few years ago, I have [written a articles](http://sitepoint.com/author/jivanoff/) for them.  

I write minimal code. That's one of the reasons I like ruby and Rails. It's like my sense of [humor](http://blog.johnivanoff.com/2013/04/clean-pun.html?utm_source=gihub&utm_medium=gihub&utm_campaign=1000bulbs), DRY.  

I can help [improve you pagespped score.](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.1000bulbs.com&tab=mobile) and [page wieght.](http://johnivanoff.com/i/1000bulbs.png)  

Thank you for your time.

John Ivanoff
