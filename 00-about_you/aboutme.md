# About Me.

I find it difficult to write about [me](http://johnivanoff.com/?utm_source=gihub&utm_medium=gihub&utm_campaign=1000bulbs) since I am the most humble person in the world. *That statement seems a bit grand.*  
Unfortunately my apps are behind firewalls. I have written a few articles for [Rubysource.com](http://rubysource.com/author/jivanoff/) and a couple of [small](http://affordablefishinganddiving.com/?utm_source=gihub&utm_medium=gihub&utm_campaign=1000bulbs) [websites](http://www.westsidetireservice.com/?utm_source=gihub&utm_medium=gihub&utm_campaign=1000bulbs) for friends. *p.s. check out the responsiveness of them.*  
Way back in 2008 I posted an [article](http://blog.johnivanoff.com/2008/02/i-needed-refresher-with-rjs-so-i.html?utm_source=gihub&utm_medium=gihub&utm_campaign=1000bulbs) on reworking RJS to work with Rails 2. Remember RJS?  
I have been [promoting](http://john-amy.com/css/presentation/s5-blank.html?utm_source=gihub&utm_medium=gihub&utm_campaign=1000bulbs) [web standards](http://blog.johnivanoff.com/2005/03/css-presentation.html?utm_source=gihub&utm_medium=gihub&utm_campaign=1000bulbs) for a long time.  
I write minimal code. That's one of the reasons I like ruby and rails. It's like my sense of [humor](http://blog.johnivanoff.com/2013/04/clean-pun.html?utm_source=gihub&utm_medium=gihub&utm_campaign=1000bulbs), DRY.  

[Shelby Mohnke](http://www.linkedin.com/in/shelbymohnke) should have sent or is going to be sending my resume.

Thank you for your time.

John Ivanoff
