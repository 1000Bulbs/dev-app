# All about you #

We'd like to know more about you. So drop your resume in here.

Got a cool web app you've built? Link us to it.
- Here is a link to my Karate website which is written in Rails
-- [Shaw Martial Arts](http://www.shawmartialarts.com)

Got a Hacker News account full of snarky/insightful comments? Rad. We want to read those snarky/insightful comments.

Got a GitHub account? We'll probably actually figure that out from the pull request. Don't worry about that one.
- The repo dojo is what I use for Shaw Martial Arts
