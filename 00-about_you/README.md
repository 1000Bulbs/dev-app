# All about you #

Hi there! I am Jared and I am a developer with big aspirations of building technology that helps the world.

In the first step of my plan to contribute to the world I need money so I have been working on a couple of projects
as SaaS app's to eventually turn into a business. I'd like to highlight a couple of them.

- Enzo Automotive is a platform to automate some tedious tasks dealerships do to sell cars such as posting them online www.enzo.autos
- Adventure Redesigned is going to be a platform to help connect influencers with brands for sponsorships in the Van Life / Adventure space www.adventureredesigned.com

I am learning new things everyday and hope to one day produce a technology that inspires and assists others with their human condition.
