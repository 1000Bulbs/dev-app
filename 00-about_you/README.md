# All about you #

Here's a place where you can include any details about yourself that you might want to share. Make sure to put your name somewhere so we can connect this PR back to your resume.

I am Osman Naseer, a business problem solver, who has passion to develop technical solutions. I learn to understand the people's needs first (User needs/ Experience) then reverse engineer into developing the design/ architecture/ code solutions that fills in the user experience gap. My goal is to connect users seamlessly to the information on any device they are using to shop online. To accomplish this, I am open to learning user trends and ever-changing technologies. 

An example from my past experience: I helped develop an E-Commerce site and blog site from scratch in which I was asked to use the technologies that I had to learn on the fly through documentation. I successfully learned and applied the technology and finished with sites that are still in use by thousands of users to interact and make purchases through these platforms.
