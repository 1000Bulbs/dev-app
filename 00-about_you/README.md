## About Me (Curtis Foster) ##

I'm a middle-aged software engineer whom likes to travel, try new foods, and spend time with family where possible. I guess i've calmed down
quite a bit in the past few years since the whole startup fever pitch in the 2010s. While I don't have any exciting (hobby built) applications living in the wild today that I can show you, I can present the following.

Pilotpool.com - Built and launched as the sole developer for ATP flight school. This web app helps airline recruiters track the flight times of students
nearing flight time requirements in order to preliminarily extend an offer of employment.

GoodTuners.com - (Not alive, but you can view it on https://archive.org/). This was a project of mine to help aftermarket automotive tuners connect with customers.

Text "Find" to 727272 with your cell phone - This is a work script created to help customers quickly locate the 3 nearest Redbox kiosk. It uses a state machine to retain where it is in the flow using your last input and mobile device number to track the session.

CSS Electronics - I'm using a CANbus logging device purchased from CSS electronics to do continuous monitoring of select data parameters within a vehicle. The device uploads the logs to an S3 bucket, a lambda function monitors for certain conditions to which if exceeded -- the log is then signaled (email is sent) for review by the tuner. It's low level telematics, but it's being used in a way that's for small group of extreme car enthusiasts, not just for large corporate fleets to monitor tires for flats.
