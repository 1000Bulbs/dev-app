I'm an experienced developer who has professionally worked with Java, Ruby,
Objective-C, SQL, more MVC frameworks than I can remember, and has a deep
understanding of web technologies, from HTTP to CSS. I take pride in my work,
professionalism, and love keeping up with the latest-and-greatest.

Lately I've been working on a side-business which orignally utilized Dropwizard
+ Hibernate ORM + Flyway, but wound up getting frustrated with it and just went with
Rails.
