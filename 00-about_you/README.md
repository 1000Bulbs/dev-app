## About me ##

I'm the kind of person who clearly spends way too much time tinkering with things. To be honest, this assignment was pretty fun, because I haven't touched ExpressJS or React in about four years, and it was great practice to build and deploy this - I learned a ton. And that really describes me. I LOVE to learn and be challenged.

My current passion project has involved learning PHP to get our dog rescue website moved over to WordPress from Joomla, to make it easier for our volunteers to update things. I wrote a fun recursive function that reaches out to our software and grabs dogs, their stats, and photos, then creates/updates posts.

I'm trying to do this on `init`, but am troubleshooting my way through this awful "WordPress has encountered a critical error" message, that basically crashes the site when it happens. I'm so close! Feel free to check it out - be warned, it's still very much under development:  https://dev.ghgsdr.org/dogs-category/available/

It started out with writing [this](https://www.ghgsdr.org/adopt/available-gsds) really quickly in EmberJS over one weekend, and everyone liked that dogs' info updated on the website as soon as we updated them in the software, so they agreed it was time for an update!

I do it all because of our adorable, wonderful girls we adopted from this rescue:

### I've got some cool projects ###

When I'm not fostering dogs, doing events for the rescue, or working on the rescue website, I enjoy woodworking and painting (on canvases). We just moved into a new house and I'm currently working on building a Murphy Bed. Oh, and I play French Horn for a local symphony!

Thanks for taking a look at my stuff. In case you need it, here's my [resum√©.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Py81W4C4hrtCWaypmM0gmuDAzXJF4YpI/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101872476462081452323&rtpof=true&sd=true)
