# All about you #

We'd like to know more about you. So drop your resume in here.

Got a cool web app you've built? Link us to it.

Got a Hacker News account full of snarky/insightful comments? Rad. We want to read those snarky/insightful comments.

Got a GitHub account? We'll probably actually figure that out from the pull request. Don't worry about that one.

<b>A Little About Me:</b> <br>
I enjoy learning new things.  Things I have learned on my own are: <br>
1.) Einstein's Field Equations and Conformal Geometry,  <br>
2.) MongoDB <br>
3.) PHP <br>
4.) MySQL <br>
5.) AJAX <br>
6.) JS and JQuery (although I am not a fan of client-side) <br>
7.) HTML <br>
8.) CSS

I also created a company with three friends and then sold it.  I am looking for a position where I can work in a
small team of developers that love to learn new technologies and implrement them.

<b>Web App:</b> <br>
