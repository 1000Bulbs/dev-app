To 1000Bulbs,

I am an independent software developer with a passion for taking real business challenges and creating solutions to solve them. I am also a student of the complete software development life-cycle. I have a 6 year background in professional programming with a year and a half of focused experience with prominent Ruby Stacks and BDD / TDD.

Growing up with a software architect for a dad, I was smitten by software development at a young age. Building applications first in C and then PHP, I learned the OOP principles, patterns and practices with which to build great software. Over the past 6 years, I’ve built web applications using REST, MVC, Unit Tests & SOA.

Having led a web development company with three employees as a co-founder, I am currently a partner at development and advertising firm based in Oklahoma City. For the past 15 months I have been working extensively with the enterprising LifeChurch.tv in Edmond, OK.

Now, I am eager to direct my own passion and knowledge towards cultivating continued growth and innovation at 1000Bulbs.

## Ruby Code Examples ##

Most of the stuff I've done on GitHub is private, but here are some public examples:

**LC API Gem**
I designed it and authored all of the code.

**Finances v0.6** 
I just not uploaded this, it was my first project in ruby and was a personal project. It parses and assesses financial records. I had to remove the actual records file because it is my personal finances, but I could demo it in action if you were interested. Check out the interpreter folder — the interpreter can handle some great english commands and the program can run a financial breakdown on any two sets of data — such as, compare the last two months to the last 5 days, etc.

## iPhone App Demo (For fun) ##

This is a video I recorded of an iPhone app which I designed and built.
