# Are you a developer? Have you ever seen a light bulb? We've got a job for you. #

But first an introduction...

## About Us ##

We're the development team behind [1000Bulbs.com](http://www.1000bulbs.com). We build the software that sells more light bulbs online than you'd probably believe *and* we've got a pretty neat development stack including:

* PHP 5.3
* Ruby on Rails
* Resque
* jQuery
* Backbone.js
* Compass/SASS/SCSS
 - We're just starting the transition to responsive layouts.
* PostgreSQL
* MongoDB
* MySQL
* Redis
* Chef
* Continuous Integration
* GitHub (obviously)

## About You (ideally) ##

You're an excellent developer, or at least you try to be. You've got experience building things with some or all of the tech listed above (or would like to). You prefer automated testing.

We're based out of Garland, TX which isn't the most exciting place (though it has been featured multiple times on *Storage Wars: Texas*), so you'll need to be somewhere within proximity.

### Benefits include ###

* Competitive Salary
* Awesome Hardware
 - MacBook Pro / Cinema Display
* Health and Dental insurance
* Paid vacation and sick days
* 401k participation
* Stock Incentive Programs
