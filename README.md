## How I tackled the assignment ##

The way I did this assignment was through react in a js component. I really wanted to created a visual component for the buzz assingment and I found that react was the best way to go. I started by making the input dynamic. Instead of making the count form 1 to 100 the user would be able to pick any integer lets say 2000 and it would count from 0 to that specific number. 

I then proceeded to create icons for the buzz counting. For every multiple of 3 you would get the electric icon and for every non multiple of 3 you would get the lightbulb icon. 

I think this visual really works well with the assingment and potrays me well when it comes to working the problem spefically with how I develop in the front end. 


## how to run the poject ##
In the repo you will find a folder called buzz-app. In the terminal if you cd to that folder and run npm start it will run the application. running npm install will also install any dependecies in the folder if need be.
